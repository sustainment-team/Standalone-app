SonarQube by KK FUNDA
=====================


Explain the flow diagram ----> Before maven and tomcat ----> SonarQube.


Def:
---

-> SonarQube is an open-source platform used for continuous inspection of code quality. 

-> It performs static code analysis to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your code.



Key Features
=============

Code Quality and Security
-------------------------

Bugs and Vulnerabilities ---> Detect and fix issues that might lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities.

Code Smells --> Identify maintainability issues in your code.

Code Coverage --> Measure how much of your code is covered by tests.

Duplication --> Detect duplicate code blocks.

Technical Debt --> Estimate the effort required to fix all the issues in the code.


Multi-Language Support
----------------------

Supports a wide range of programming languages including Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, Python, PHP, and many more.

Quality Gates
-------------
Set thresholds for quality metrics to ensure code meets the standards before it is integrated into the main branch.

what is the diff between code review and code coverage?
=========================================================

code coverage:
--------------

Number of lines tested through unit test cases called as code coverage.

In any project 80% need to satisfy.

Benefits: Helps identify untested areas of code

Tools: Tools like JaCoCo (for Java)



code review:
------------

Code review is the process of manually reviewing code by team members to find bugs, ensure to following  coding standards, and improve overall code quality.

Benefits: It Leads to better software quality, fewer bugs, and promotes best practices within the development team.

Tools: Code review tools include GitHub Pull Requests.

--> It will supports multile browsers like chrome, safari, IE, Microsoft edge, etc
--> It will identify the bwlow issues:
   1. Duplicate code
   2. Coding standards
   3. unit test cases
   4. complex code
   5. comments
   6. potential bugs [ Exception handlings]
   .........
