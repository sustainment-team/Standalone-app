1. Nexus ---> [sonatype vendor] ---> called as a sonatype nexus
2. Jfrog .....



git -->GitHub/Gitlab/bitbucket  --->









IQ] what is the difference between GitHub and nexus?

GitHub: used to manage the source code, Dockerfile  
Nexus : used to manage the build artifacts and docker images









Nexus installation
==================

prerequsites
------------

--> java 1.8 or java 8 is required for 3.x version



Hardware requirements
----------------------
--> min 2GB RAM required for Nexus and 1 GB RAM for server, so we are going with "t2.medium"

--> It is a cross platform software.

--> It is not a installation software, Has only in the archive file.

NOTE: After installation of nexus software , Two directories are created.
     
      1. nexus3.x
      2. sonatype_work ----> common for all versions.




Installation starts
===================



step 1: Launch an EC2 instance [t2.medium]

step 2: connect to that server.

step 3: Before installation check the RAM once: "free -h "

step 4: sudo su -

step 5: check whether java is installed or not.

     javac -version

step 6: Install java
 
sudo rpm --import https://yum.corretto.aws/corretto.key
sudo curl -Lo /etc/yum.repos.d/corretto.repo https://yum.corretto.aws/corretto.repo
sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto-devel --nogpgcheck



java -version

step 7: 

cd /opt	

yum install tar wget tree -y

step 8: 





wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.70.1-02-java8-unix.tar.gz


step 9: 

tar -zxvf nexus-3.70.1-02-java8-unix.tar.gz


step 10:

mv /opt/nexus-3.70.1-02 /opt/nexus



****NOTE: As a good security practice, Nexus is not advised to run nexus service as a root user, so create a new user called nexus and grant sudo access to manage nexus services as follows.


step 11: 

useradd nexus

step 12: Give the sudo access to nexus user

visudo
nexus ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

step 13: Change the owner and group permissions to /opt/nexus and /opt/sonatype-work directories.

chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/nexus
chown -R nexus:nexus /opt/sonatype-work

chmod -R 775 /opt/nexus
chmod -R 775 /opt/sonatype-work


step 14: Open /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc file and  uncomment run_as_user parameter and set as nexus user.

vi /opt/nexus/bin/nexus.rc
run_as_user="nexus"

#step 15: Create nexus as a service

#ln -s /opt/nexus/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus


step 16: Switch as a nexus user and start the nexus service as follows.

sudo su - nexus




step 17: Enable the nexus services

sudo systemctl status nexus

sudo systemctl enable nexus



/***

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/nexus.service

[Unit]
Description=nexus service
After=network.target

[Service]

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload


sudo systemctl enable nexus
sudo systemctl start nexus
sudo systemctl status nexus


****/

step 18: Start the nexus service

sudo systemctl start nexus

step 19:  Access the Nexus server from Laptop/Desktop browser.

http://52.66.73.219:8081/

step 20: click on login

NOTE: Before 3.15 version uname and password is admin and admin123 , But now process changed.

cat /opt/sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password

Uname: admin   pwd: kkfunda
